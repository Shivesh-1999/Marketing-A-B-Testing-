Our journey begins with a meticulous exploration of the dataset, which includes variables such as the day of the week with the highest ad displays, the hour of the day with the most ad displays, and the total number of ads shown to prospects. We'll methodically pair each variable with the conversion status, creating insightful visualizations like stacked bar charts, pie charts, and box plots to uncover meaningful patterns and trends.

üîç With our exploratory analysis complete, we'll move on to the heart of A/B testing‚Äîstatistical hypothesis testing. We'll perform a proper chi-squared test of dependence to assess the relationship between categorical variables and the conversion status. Additionally, we'll conduct a Mann-Whitney U test to compare the distributions of a continuous variable between the two groups, providing robust statistical validation to our findings.
